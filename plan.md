# MCPtrace Improvement Plan

Based on comparison with GPTtrace, here's a prioritized roadmap to enhance MCPtrace:

## Phase 1: Core Feature Enhancements (2-3 weeks)

### 1. Example Database with Semantic Search
- [ ] Create SQLite database for bpftrace examples
- [ ] Implement vector embeddings using candle or ort
- [ ] Add `search_examples` tool for finding relevant traces
- [ ] Pre-populate with 50+ common tracing patterns

### 2. Program Validation & Safety
- [ ] Add `validate_program` tool for pre-execution checks
- [ ] Implement AST-based validation
- [ ] Create safety rules engine
- [ ] Add resource usage estimation

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- [ ] Implement automatic retry with exponential backoff
- [ ] Parse bpftrace errors into structured format
- [ ] Add error categorization (syntax, permission, resource)
- [ ] Provide AI-friendly error explanations

## Phase 2: Advanced Features (3-4 weeks)

### 4. Result Analysis Tools
- [ ] Create `analyze_result` tool for structured output parsing
- [ ] Add statistical analysis for numeric data
- [ ] Implement pattern detection in trace outputs
- [ ] Generate summaries and insights

### 5. Template System
- [ ] Build template engine for common patterns
- [ ] Create templates: syscall tracking, performance profiling, network monitoring
- [ ] Add template customization parameters
- [ ] Implement template composition

### 6. Interactive Features
- [ ] Add `stop_execution` tool for running traces
- [ ] Implement real-time output streaming
- [ ] Create interactive parameter adjustment
- [ ] Add execution progress monitoring

## Phase 3: Integration & Polish (2-3 weeks)

### 7. Knowledge Base
- [ ] Create comprehensive probe documentation
- [ ] Add kernel version compatibility matrix
- [ ] Build troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Include performance tuning tips

### 8. Advanced Query Features
- [ ] Natural language to bpftrace translator
- [ ] Query optimization suggestions
- [ ] Multi-probe correlation support
- [ ] Time-series data handling

### 9. Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Integration tests with various kernel versions
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Migration guide from GPTtrace

## Quick Wins (Can start immediately)

1. **Add more descriptive tool responses** - Include execution statistics, warnings
2. **Implement basic templates** - Start with 5-10 most common patterns
3. **Create example catalog** - Even without search, a curated list helps
4. **Add execution metadata** - Timestamps, duration, resource usage

## Technical Implementation Notes

- Maintain Rust's async architecture advantages
- Keep MCP protocol compliance
- Ensure backward compatibility
- Focus on security and resource limits
- Use existing crates where possible (sqlx, candle, serde)

## Success Metrics

- Reduce average trace creation time by 50%
- Achieve 90%+ first-attempt success rate
- Support 100+ pre-built examples
- Handle 95% of GPTtrace use cases
- Maintain <100ms tool response time

## Migration Support

- Create GPTtrace compatibility layer
- Provide conversion scripts
- Document feature mapping
- Offer side-by-side comparison guide
