# Security Considerations for MCPtrace

> ⚠️ **WARNING**: This MCP server executes system-level tracing commands with elevated privileges. Proper security configuration is CRITICAL.

## Overview

MCPtrace provides AI assistants with access to powerful Linux kernel tracing capabilities through bpftrace. This requires careful security considerations to prevent unauthorized system access or malicious code execution.

## Critical Security Issues

### 1. Privileged Execution

**Risk**: bpftrace requires root privileges to access kernel tracing facilities.

**Current Implementation**: 
- The server prompts for sudo password at startup
- Password is cached in memory for the session duration only
- Password is never written to disk or logs

**Configuration Options**:

1. **Default: Password Prompt** (Current implementation):
   - Server prompts for password when started
   - Password cached securely in memory
   - Suitable for interactive use

2. **Alternative: Passwordless sudo** (Recommended for production):
   ```bash
   # Add to /etc/sudoers using visudo
   your_username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/bpftrace
   ```

3. **Container Deployment**:
   - Use Docker with appropriate capabilities
   - Isolate the server from the host system
   - Pass credentials via environment variables

**Security Considerations**:
- Password is transmitted to sudo via stdin using -S flag
- Memory containing password is not swapped to disk
- Password cleared when server stops

### 2. Code Injection Risks

**Risk**: Arbitrary bpftrace code execution could compromise system security.

**Current State**: No input validation or sanitization.

**Mitigations**:
- Only use MCPtrace with trusted AI clients
- Review all generated bpftrace programs before execution
- Consider implementing an allowlist of safe trace patterns
- Monitor server logs for suspicious activity

### 3. Resource Exhaustion

**Risk**: Malicious or poorly written traces could consume excessive system resources.

**Current Limits**:
- 60-second execution timeout
- 10,000 line output buffer
- No CPU or memory limits

**Recommendations**:
- Implement CPU and memory quotas
- Add rate limiting per client
- Monitor system resource usage
- Set up alerts for abnormal behavior

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Principle of Least Privilege

- Run the MCP server as a dedicated user
- Grant only necessary permissions
- Use AppArmor or SELinux profiles if available
- Restrict file system access

### 2. Network Security

- Never expose the server directly to the internet
- Use secure transport (TLS) for remote connections
- Implement proper authentication mechanisms
- Consider using a reverse proxy with authentication

### 3. Audit and Monitoring

- Enable comprehensive logging
- Monitor all executed bpftrace programs
- Set up alerts for suspicious patterns
- Regularly review access logs

### 4. Input Validation

Until proper validation is implemented:
- Manually review generated traces
- Use only with trusted AI models
- Implement external validation scripts
- Consider a human-in-the-loop approval process

## Secure Configuration Example

```bash
# 1. Create dedicated user
sudo useradd -r -s /bin/false mcptrace

# 2. Configure passwordless sudo for bpftrace only
echo "mcptrace ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/bpftrace" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/mcptrace

# 3. Set restrictive permissions
sudo chmod 0440 /etc/sudoers.d/mcptrace

# 4. Run server as dedicated user
sudo -u mcptrace python /path/to/server.py
```

## Threat Model

### Potential Threats

1. **Malicious Trace Execution**: Attacker executes harmful bpftrace programs
2. **Information Disclosure**: Sensitive kernel data exposed through traces
3. **Denial of Service**: Resource exhaustion through intensive traces
4. **Privilege Escalation**: Exploiting bpftrace vulnerabilities
5. **Data Exfiltration**: Using traces to extract sensitive information

### Mitigations

1. **Access Control**: Strict authentication and authorization
2. **Input Validation**: Sanitize and validate all trace programs
3. **Resource Limits**: Enforce CPU, memory, and time constraints
4. **Audit Logging**: Log all operations with full context
5. **Network Isolation**: Restrict network access from trace context

## Incident Response

If you suspect a security incident:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Stop the MCP server
   - Review recent trace executions
   - Check system logs for anomalies
   - Isolate affected systems

2. **Investigation**:
   - Analyze executed bpftrace programs
   - Review system call logs
   - Check for unauthorized file access
   - Monitor network traffic

3. **Recovery**:
   - Revoke compromised credentials
   - Update security configurations
   - Patch identified vulnerabilities
   - Implement additional controls

## Security Checklist

Before deploying MCPtrace:

- [ ] Configured passwordless sudo for bpftrace
- [ ] Created dedicated user account
- [ ] Restricted sudo access to bpftrace binary only
- [ ] Implemented logging and monitoring
- [ ] Reviewed and understood threat model
- [ ] Tested incident response procedures
- [ ] Documented security configuration
- [ ] Trained users on security best practices

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Contact the maintainers privately
3. Provide detailed reproduction steps
4. Allow time for a fix before disclosure

## Future Security Enhancements

Planned improvements:
- Bpftrace program validation and sanitization
- Sandboxed execution environment
- Formal security audit
- Integration with security frameworks
- Automated threat detection
